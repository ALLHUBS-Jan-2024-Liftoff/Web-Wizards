 A challenging project for LaunchCode's Liftoff Program, designed to test and refine web development skills, and launch careers in the tech industry.

 Purpose: ShowMOEvents aims to faciliate seamless communication regarding local events within the Midwest as well as create a sense of community among residents and visitors, specifically in Missouri and surrounding areas and regions. Our goal is to create a platform that connects people based on their location, fostering community engagement and local interactions. By providing a user-friendly and secure environment, we aim to enhance connectivity and collaboration among users in the same area, whether for social, professional, or emergency purposes.

 Current State: ShowMOEvents is currently in the inital phases of the software development lifecycle, specifically the planning and analysis and design phases. We are currently working on carefully planning the design of the back end and the database architecture. We are analysing what the current surrounding environment and getting a sense of what is desired in regards to a project of this stature, and aim to build our design off of that. We have also started some implementation of the underlying foundational codebase and frameworks using Java and Spring Boot.

 Future State: Key components such as user authentication, basic messaging functionalties, and inital database schema are under development. ShowMOEvents will have the capability to register new users, logging in, and creating and uploading basic text posts. This foundational work sets the stage for further development and feature integration.
